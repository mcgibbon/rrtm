Introduction
============

pyrrtm is a python wrapper around the `rapid radiative transfer model
(RRTM) <http://rtweb.aer.com/rrtm_frame.html>`_. The wrappers for the
longwave and shortwave models are described in :doc:`lw` and
:doc:`sw`. This package aims to be a flexible and lightweight wrapper,
and attribute names mirror the variable names in the underlying
FORTRAN codes. Usage should be familiar to anyone with experience of
the RRTM codes, and relatively straightforward to those without.
