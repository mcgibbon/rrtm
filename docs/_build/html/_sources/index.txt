Welcome to pyrrtm's documentation!
==================================

pyrrtm is a python wrapper around the `rapid radiative transfer model
(RRTM) <http://rtweb.aer.com/rrtm_frame.html>`_. This package aims to
be a flexible and lightweight wrapper, and attribute names mirror the
variable names in the underlying FORTRAN codes. Therefore, usage
should be familiar to anyone with experience of the RRTM codes.
