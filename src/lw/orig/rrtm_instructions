 INPUT_RRTM Instructions
-------------------------

 RECORD 1.1
 
      CXID:  80 characters of user identification  (80A1)
 
            CXID(1) is the flag which determines program initialization and termination.  
                    The actual input data stream for RRTM commences with the record 
                    containing a '$' in CXID(1).  Any records that are read prior to a 
                    record containing a '$' in CXID(1) are ignored.Since RRTM automatically
                    recycles and reads Record 1.1 at the end of each run (this allows the 
		    stacking of multiple runs), each subsequent run of RRTM must also have 
	            a '$' in CXID(1) on Record 1.1.  In order to effect a normal termination of 
                    RRTM, CXID(1) should be set to '%', on the final record of
                    the input file.  Thus a standard RRTM input file would begin with a '$' 
                    and end with a '%'.  

 RECORD 1.2
 
      IATM,  IXSECT, ISCAT,  NUMANGS,   IOUT,   ICLD
 
        50,      70,      83,  84-85,  88-90,     95   
 
   49X, I1, 19X, I1, 12X, I1,     I2, 2X, I3, 4X, I1
 
 
	  IATM   (0,1)   flag for RRTATM 
	  	    1 = yes

	  IXSECT (0,1) flag for cross-sections
                  = 0  no cross-sections included in calculation
                  = 1  cross-sections included in calculation

	  ISCAT (0,1,2) flag for radiative transfer solver 
		  = 0  Use RRTM radiative transfer solver (see Mlawer et al., 1997), 
		       only absorption considered (i.e. no scattering).

	          = 1  Use DISORT radiative transfer solver, only absorption considered 
		       (i.e. no scattering).  (Note: This option is significantly slower than
		       ISCAT = 0 and provides no accuracy benefit.  The option is available to facilitate
		       forcing calculations in conjunction with ISCAT = 2.)

	          = 2  Use DISORT radiative transfer solver, absorption and scattering 
		       is considered. (Note: Please see instructions for IN_CLD_RRTM for restrictions
		       when using this option.)

		       longwave. J. Geophys. Res., 102, 16,663-16,682, 1997

	  NUMANGS (0,1,2,3,4) flag for number of quadrature angles to use in RT 
                       calculations.
	  	       If ISCAT = 0 then the NUMANGS choices are:
          
		       NUMANGS = 0 if the radiance is to be computed at 1 angle, the cosine of
                                   which equals 1/1.66 (standard angle in diffusivity approximation)
	                       = n (1-4) if the radiances are to be computed at n angles 
		                   chosen such that their cosines have the standard x-axis 
	        	           values in first-moment Gaussian quadrature.  This requires 
	               	           the computation of one exponential for each angle.

	  	       If ISCAT = 1 then the NUMANGS choices correspond to the number of streams 
		       to be used in DISORT.  These quadrature angles are not identical to those used in
                       ISCAT = 0.

        	       NUMANGS = 0  - 4 streams
	                       = 1  - 8 streams
                	       = 2  - 16 streams 

	  IOUT = -1 if no output is to be printed out.
	       =  0 if the only output is for 10-3250 cm-1.
	       =  n (n = 1-16) if the only output is from band n.
		    For the wavenumbers for each band, see Table I.
	       = 99 if output is generated for 17 spectral intervals, one
		    for the full longwave spectrum (10-3250 cm-1), and one 
		    for each of the 16 bands.
 
	  ICLD   (0,1,2) flag for clouds
                  = 0  no cloudy layers in atmosphere
                  = 1  one or more cloudy layers present in atmosphere.  Cloud layers
		       are treated using a random overlap assmption.
                       (requires the presence of file IN_CLD_RRTM)
                  = 2  one or more cloudy layers present in atmosphere.  Cloud layers
		       are treated using a maximum/random overlap assmption.

                = 2 each band has different surface emissivity (for band IB, equal to SEMISS(IB))

         IREFLECT = 0 for Lambertian reflection at surface, i.e. reflected radiance 
			is equal at all angles
                  = 1 for specular reflection at surface, i.e. reflected radiance at angle
			is equal to downward surface radiance at same angle multiplied by
			the reflectance
                  (Note:  for each band, surface reflectance = 1 - surface emissivity) 

         SEMISS   the surface emissivity for each band (see Table I).  All values must be 
                  greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1.  If IEMIS = 1, only
                  SEMISS(1) is considered.  If IEMIS = 2 and no surface emissivity value 
                  is given for SEMISS(IB), a value of 1.0 is used for band IB.
